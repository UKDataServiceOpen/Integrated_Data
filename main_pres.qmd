# 1. Why a webinar series on data linkage?

## The world is changing


- Once upon a time: mostly census and surveys (lots!)
- Emerging / new kinds of data in the last 20 years
    1. Administrative data
    2. Digital trace data (i.e. social media, web...)
    3. Smart data (i.e. flow, device generated)
    - 2 and 3: genuinely new data 
    - 1: Digitalisation of records  $\longrightarrow$ greater availability
- Increased demand  for personal insights: [the Monitored Self](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-69944-3_8)
- Potential for new research avenues at a lower cost... 


## Growing role of non-survey data {.smaller}
 
- Why interest is growing
  - New and previously unavailable measurements
  - Large scale, high frequency, low marginal cost
  - Attractiveness of 'harder' type of data...
   - ... Particularly in social epidemiology and socio-economic research

 - But:
    - Collected for administrative purposes, not research
    - Selective coverage $\longrightarrow$ population exclusions
    - Measurement error, changing definitions, policy artefacts
    - Limited socio-demographic and subjective information


## The survey landscape {.smaller}

- Data collection challenges... 
  - Rising costs under tighter budgets
  - Recruitment is harder (reach, refusals, panel fatigue)
  - Alleviation comes at a cost:  larger samples, incentives
  - Growth of online and mixed-mode designs
 
- ... But they remain essential:
  - Only source for attitudes, beliefs, motivations, well-being
  - Rich socio-demographic information not captured elsewhere: detailed occupation, social class, ethnicity
  - Theory-driven, validated instruments (ex: GHQ)
  - Only tested tool for population representative data, hard to reach groups and subgroup analysis


<!-- ## Increasing number of  actors -->
<!-- - Large academic data producers: CLS; ISER; ONS; NatCen -->
<!-- - Linkage intermediaries: LLC, ADR, SAIL; SDR -->
<!-- - Data curator: UKDS -->
<!-- - Other consortiums: CLOSER -->
<!-- - Government departments; health and education providers -->
<!-- - $\longrightarrow$ not always easy for researchers and analysts to navigate the landscape -->


## In a nutshell {.smaller}

- Budgetary pressures on survey data
- Wealth of cheaper, but narrowly focused, often unrepresentative new forms of data
- Data integration is a win-win: potential to improve (validation and enhancement) of both kinds of data  (Benzeval 2020)
- At the same time:
  - Linkage is still a limited (but growing)  practice and few linked datasets are available for secondary research
  - Increased complexity of the data provision landscape
  - Need to  adapt the skills training/capacity building



# 2. Exploring <br>  integrated data

## Working definition {.smaller}

- Combining different sources of data ie:

  - Survey data $\leftrightsquigarrow$ survey data
  - Survey data $\leftrightsquigarrow$ non survey data
  - Non survey data $\leftrightsquigarrow$  non survey data
- That includes  a shared unit of observation (individual, household, area...)
- ... In a coherent way in order to:
  - Validate or 
  - .. enhance the original data
- Bidirectional
- In this presentation: linkage = integration

## Validation  example {.smaller}

- Whiffen et al (2020) [How effective are population health surveys for estimating prevalence of chronic conditions compared to anonymised clinical data?](https://doi.org/10.23889/ijpds.v5i1.1151)
- Reliability of population survey-based  estimates of chronic diseases 
- Data linkage to validate prevalence of selected chronic conditions:
    - Angina, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and asthma
- Link 11,323 adults from the 2013 and 2014 Welsh Health Survey to clinical data
- Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank
- Results: quality depends on condition:
  - Less agreement for cardiovascular, better for asthma
  - Potentially cheaper
  - But not devoid of technical difficulties



# Kinds of data linked to survey data

## Administrative data {.smaller}
- Usually arising from the interaction between:
    - A public organisation or body...
    - ... the unit for which records are produced (ie people)
- Exemples:
  - Registry data: birth, death, marriage records, 
  - Health records, educational transcripts
  - Government records: benefits, earnings/income
  - Financial reports ie credit ratings, mortgage application 
  
- In the UK: enabled Digital Economy Act 2017:

  "*... de-identified data from government service providers, excluding NHS data, as part of their day-to-day functions, may be shared for public good research*"



<!-- ## School inspection data -->

<!-- -   OFSTED 'State of the nation': anonymised data on latest schools inspections outcomes of 22,000 open schools -->

<!-- -   Linked with the MCS, currently covers years 2005 to 2019 -->

<!-- -   Data on a wide range of topics i.e.: -->

<!--     -   Quality of teaching, learning and assessment -->
<!--     -   Effectiveness of leadership and management -->
<!--     -   Pupils' achievement (aggregated) (2005-2015) -->
<!--     -   Behaviour and safety of pupils (2005-2015) -->

## Linking survey with digital trace data

- Arising from our presence online (web or apps)
- Increasing usage of linked survey and social media data
- Typical example: asking survey respondents to have their SM behaviour tracked
- May  reduce the cost of the survey (fewer questions to ask)
- Subject to user consent: representativeness issues
- Consent depends on the app, gender, etc..
- [DIGISURVOR](https://digisurvor.github.io/main/) project for an example of current research
  - Linkage of existing survey data with online participation in political discussions
  


## Smart data {.smaller}

- Fuzzier definition
  - Digital records held by private sector organisations
  - Often but not always device-recorded data
  - Not traditionally associated with social research
  - Flow/ quasi real time data
- Examples:
   - Data from fitness trackers, smart watches, and in-car smart tech $\longrightarrow$ health and mobility research    
   - Financial transactions by  businesses and individuals loyalty cards, purchase records  < banks, supermarkets$\longrightarrow$ financial behaviour and resilience
   - Energy network data (distribution & consumption); EV usage and charging; smart meter readings $\longrightarrow$  building/households energy consumptions$\longrightarrow$ net zero targets



<!-- ## (Bio measurement data) -->

<!-- - Collected as part large scale longitudinal surveys (often via nurse visit): -->

<!--   - Blood sample -->
<!--   - Epigenetic data -->
<!--   - Cortisol levels -->

<!-- - Is this integrated data? -->


# 3. Which survey data are most commonly  linked?

<!-- ## Linked survey data: in theory -->

<!-- -   Depends on: -->

<!--     -   The topic covered by the  data linked i.e. does it match common topics studied in surveys? -->
<!--     -   The survey itself (i.e. does it include the required linking information / user consent) -->
<!--     -   ... Scope of the surveys i.e. is linkage part of the original data collection,  or is it a subsequent project? -->
<!--     -   Means available from the data producer -->


## ... In practice

-   Major longitudinal studies:

    -   Birth cohort studies
    -   Next Steps and ELSA
    -   Understanding Society

-   A few large scale cross-sectional surveys such as:

    -   ASHE (Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings)

# 4. Data integration and skills requirements

## Survey analysis skills
- Traditional deterministic matching (ie merging)
  - The simplest case: individual level data matched to individual level data non ambiguous identifier
  - The same holds to aggregate level (for example smart sensor small area level matching)

- Probabilistic matching
   - When separate ids
   - When data is not clean

- Statistical inference & non random samples 

## Emerging skills {.smaller}
- Computational skills 
  - Non-survey  cleaning (Pandas, Tidyverse)
  - Web scrapping (Python/R)
  - API queries (social media app: X, Reddit...)
  - Pattern detection ie random forest

- Regulatory knowledge
  - Data protection & GDPR - prerequisite $\longrightarrow$ UKDS Safe researcher training
  - Departmental regulations in case of Governmental data
  - Institutional/procedural: ie how to engage with the data matching intermediaries  
 
# 5. Who's who in the data integration landscape

## Data producers 
- Involved in data matching (ea consent management)
- Data producers of the main longitudinal studies ie 
  - Understanding Society (ISER)
  - Main cohort studies (CLS)
- Government departments and the ONS
- Private sector organisations


## Administrative Data Research (ADR) 
- Consortium of organisations, including the ONS, devolved governments and academic partners
- Mission: 
  - link and open up de-identified  administrative data 
  - making it securely available to accredited researchers.
- Point of access for new data linkage within the  public sector and between the public sector and researchers  

## UK Longitudinal Linking Consortium
- Trusted Research Environment - TRE
- Currently enables linkage between longitudinal studies and data from:

  - NHS England
  - Neighbourhood geographies
  - Address geographies

- In preparation: NHS Wales, Department for Work and Pensions, HM Revenue and Customs data

<!-- ## UK Data service -->
<!--  - Collection, curation and access to linked survey data -->
<!--  - Main gateway for secondary survey data analysis -->
<!--  - Curates some linked data -->
<!--  - Trusted Research environment -->


## Other intermediaries (not exhaustive) {.smaller}
- Smart Data Research UK
  - Gathers smart data from producers: ie financial, energy data, smart device...  
  - Makes it available to the research community
  - Organised by kind of smart data

- Secure Anonymised Information Linkage -SAIL
  - Wales based but provides also access to UK data, (mostly) health-related
  - Trusted Research Environment - TRE

- CeLCIUS
  - Census data linkage


# 6. Data linkage at UKDS: roles, routes, and researcher options

## The UK Data Service and data linkage: <br> core principles

- UKDS does not create linkages or integrate data
- Linked data are created by data owners or processors
- UKDS negotiates access to these data collections and makes them research-ready and safely accessible
- The type of linkage researchers can undertake depends on:
  - the access level (Open / Safeguarded / Controlled)
  - the presence or absence of identifiers


## What researchers can do in UKDS SecureLab {.smaller}
- Researchers can:
  - Access more granular variables​
  - Create derived or contextual linkages, for example:​  
  - Environmental or pollution deciles based on postcode-derived measures​
  - Area-level deprivation or service access indicators​
  - Import external datasets subject to depositor approval​

- Key considerations:
  - UKDS SecureLab does not host direct identifiers
  - Researchers cannot create linkage spines or perform identifier-based matching​
  - All linkage activity must be explicitly approved as part of the project

# 7. How to access linked data at UKDS

## Conclusion so far

- Potential for  exciting new research, some of which is already happening
- Dynamic landscape, changes in the role of actors likely to take place
- Need for investigating capacity building/skills training
- Kind of data  left out for now: Census (longitudinal & administrative linkage)
- Please follow us for additional webinars on digital trace, administrative and smart data
