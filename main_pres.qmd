# 2. Why a webinar series on data linkage?

## Changing data landscape


- Once upon a time: census and surveys (lots of them!)
- Emerging kind of data in the past 20 years
  1. Administrative data
  2. Digital trace data (i.e. social media, web...)
  3. Smart data

  <!-- - ... -->

- 2 and 3: genuinely new data 
- 1: Digitalisation of records  $\longrightarrow$ greater availability
- Increased demand  for personal insights: [the Monitored Self](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-69944-3_8)
- Potential for new research avenues at a lower cost... 


## Growing role of non-survey data {.smaller}
 
- Why interest is growing
  - New and previously unavailable measurements
  - Large scale, high frequency, low marginal cost
  - Particularly in social epidemiology and socio-economic research
  - Attractiveness of 'harder' type of data

 
- But...
  - Collected for administrative purposes, not research
  - Selective coverage and population exclusions
  - Measurement error, changing definitions, policy artefacts
  - Limited socio-demographic and subjective information


## Surveys are changing... 

- Rising costs under tighter budgets
- Increasing fieldwork complexity
- Recruitment challenges (reach, refusals, panel fatigue)
- Alleviation comes at a cost:  larger samples, incentives
- Growth of online and mixed-mode designs
 
## ... But they remain essential:

- Only source for attitudes, beliefs, motivations, well-being
- Rich socio-demographic information not captured elsewhere: detailed occupation, social class, ethnicity
- Theory-driven measurements and validated instruments (ex: GHQ)
- Only tested tool for population representative data, hard to reach groups and subgroup analysis


## Increasing number of  actors
- Large data producers: CLS; ISER; ONS; government departments
- Linkage intermediaries: LLC, ADR, SAIL; SDR
- Data curator: UKDS
- Other consortiums: CLOSER
- Government departments; health and education providers
- $\longrightarrow$ not always easy for researchers and analysts to navigate the landscape

## Skills needs {.smaller}

- Blurring boundary between computational methods and survey research
- Existing basic skills
  - Individual and  aggregate merging

- Managing new types of data
  - Web/social media scrapping via API
  - Data cleaning/processing
  - Probability matching
  - Inference and non random surveys
- Navigating the increasingly complex  regulatory framework

## Conclusion

- Budgetary pressures on survey data
- Wealth of cheaper, but narrowly focused, often unrepresentative new forms of data
- Complexification of the data provision landscape: increased opacity for non experts
- Need to  adapt the skills training/capacity building
- Data integration enables validation and enhancement of both kinds of data  (Benzeval 2020)
- Linkage is still limited (but growing)  practice and few linked datasets are available for secondary research



# 2. Exploring <br>  integrated data

## Working definition {.smaller}

- Combining different sources of data ie:
  - Survey data $\leftrightsquigarrow$ survey data
  - Survey data $\leftrightsquigarrow$ non survey data
  - Non survey data $\leftrightsquigarrow$  non survey data
- That include  a shared unit of obsservation (individual, household, area...)
- ... In a coherent way in order to:
  - Validate or 
  - .. enhance the original data
- Bidirectional

## Validation  (Whiffen et al 2005) {.smaller}

- Effectiveness of  population health surveys for estimating prevalence of chronic conditions
- Reliability of survey-based prevalence estimates for chronic diseases is unclear 
- Data linkage  to validate prevalence of selected chronic conditions:
    - Angina, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and asthma.
- Link 11,323 adults from the 2013 and 2014 Welsh Health Survey to clinical data
- Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank
- Results: depends on condition:
  - Less agreement for cardiovascular, better for asthma
  - Potentially cheaper
  - Difficulty

## Enhancing surveys with social media data

- Increasing usage of linked survey and social media data
- Typical example: asking survey respondents to have their SM behaviour tracked
- Potentially reduce the cost of the survey
- Subject to consent: representativeness issues
- Success depend on the app, gendeer, etc..
- [DIGISURVOR]() project for an exemple of current research


# Kinds of data linked to survey data

## Administrative data {.smaller}
- Usually arising from the interaction between:
    - An organisation (typically  public body)...
    - ... the unit for which records are produced (ie people)
- Birth or death certification, mortgage or benefits application, filing tax returns, going to the GP  or the A&E
- Exemples:
  - Registry data: birth, death, marriage records, 
  - Health records, educational transcripts
  - Government records: benefits, earnings/income
  - Financial reports 
- In the UK: Digital Economy Act 2017:

  "... de-identified1 data from government service providers, excluding NHS data, as part of their day-to-day functions, may be shared for public good research"

# Examples

## Hospital episodes data

-   NHS data about all hospital admissions in England.
-   Four datasets:
    -   Episodes of using: Accident and Emergency, Admitted Patient Care, Adult Critical Care, Outpatients
    -   Mostly available for 2007/9-2023
-   Data on diagnosis, maternity, mortality, mental health, treatment’s length, deprivation etc.
-   Available for the NCDS Birth Cohort

# Which survey data are most commonly  linked?

## Linked survey data: in theory

-   Depends on:

    -   The topic covered by the  data linked i.e. does it match common topics studied in surveys?
    -   The survey itself (i.e. does it include the required linking information / user consent)
    -   ... Scope of the surveys i.e. is linkage part of the original data collection,  or is it a subsequent project?
    -   Means available from the data producer


## ... And in practice

-   Major longitudinal studies:

    -   Birth cohort studies
    -   Next Steps and ELSA
    -   Understanding Society

-   A few large scale cross-sectional surveys such as:

    -   ASHE (Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings)
    -   Family Resources Survey
    -   Scottish Health Survey (project)


## Birth cohort studies

-   Follow a sample of individuals over their whole life
-   Born during  a specific period of 1958(NCDS), 1970(BCS), 2000 (MCS), 2026 (Generation New Era)
-   Millenium Cohort Study (MCS)
    -   \~ 19,000 children  (born between June 2001 and Jan 03)
    -   7 'sweeps': 9 months then at 3, 5, 7, 11, 14, years old
    -   Parent and child interviews
    -   Focuses on education, skills and health, truancy, cognitive ability, biological measurements 
    -   ... Traditional socio-economic and demographic data

## Other cohort studies

# 3. Overview of Data integration techniques and skills needs

## Computational social science 
- Web scrapping (Python/R)
- API queries (X, Reddit...)
- Pattern detection ie random forest
- Data cleaning (Pandas, Tidyverse)

## Data matching
- Traditional merging:
  - The simplest case: individual level data matched to individual level data non ambiguous identifier
  - The same holds to aggregate level (for example smart sensor small area level matching)

- Deterministic vs probabilistic matching
 - When separate ids
 - When data is not clean
 
# 4. Who's who in the data integration landscape

## Administrative Data Research (ADR) 
- Consortium of organisations, including the ONS, devolved governments and academic partners
- Mission: 
  - "link...
  - and open upde identified  data 
  - generated from people’s interactions with public services, 
  - making it securely available to accredited researchers.
- Point of access for new data linkage within the  public sector and between the public sector and researchers

# 5. Data linkage at UKDS: roles, routes, and researcher options

## The UK Data Service and data linkage: <br> core principles

- UKDS does not create linkages or integrate data
- Linked data are created by data owners or processors
- UKDS negotiates access to these data collections and makes them
research-ready and safely accessible
- The type of linkage researchers can undertake depends on:
  - the access level (Open / Safeguarded / Controlled)
  - the presence or absence of identifiers


## What researchers can do in UKDS SecureLab {.smaller}
- Researchers can:
  - Access more granular variables​
  - Create derived or contextual linkages, for example:​  
  - Environmental or pollution deciles based on postcode-derived measures​
  - Area-level deprivation or service access indicators​
  - Import external datasets subject to depositor approval​

- Key considerations:
  - UKDS SecureLab does not host direct identifiers
  - Researchers cannot create linkage spines or perform identifier-based
matching​
  - All linkage activity must be explicitly approved as part of the project
